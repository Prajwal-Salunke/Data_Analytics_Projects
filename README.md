# Data Analytics Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Data Analysis** projects created using **Python**!  
This repository includes two insightful projects:

1. **Diwali Sales Analysis**  
2. **Weather Data Analysis**

## üîç Project Overviews

### 1. Diwali Sales Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze retail sales data during the Diwali festival to understand trends and shopper behavior.
- **Key Insights:**

| **Aspect**             | **Key Insight**                                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Marital Status         | Higher purchase frequency among **unmarried customers**           |
| Zone-wise Sales        | **Central zone** had the highest sales; **East zone** the lowest  |
| Product Popularity     | Most sold: **Food**, **Clothing** <br> Least sold: **Books**, **Office supplies** |
| Gender-Based Revenue   | **Female customers** spent ~‚Çπ74M vs **Male customers** ~‚Çπ32M      |
| Age Group Revenue      | **26‚Äì35 age group** were top spenders (~‚Çπ42.6M)                   |
| Category Revenue       | Highest revenue from **Food**, followed by **Clothing** and **Electronics** |
- **Techniques & Tools Used:**
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, data types)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
  - Visualizations: bar charts, line plots, heatmaps to showcase sales patterns
  - Sales forecasting and insights for business stakeholders

### 2. Weather Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Explore and analyze historical weather data to uncover seasonal patterns and trends.
### üå¶Ô∏è Weather Data Analysis ‚Äì Key Insights Summary

| **Aspect**                | **Key Insight**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monthly Temperature       | Clear **seasonal pattern**, with **summer months** showing highest average temps, and **winter months** the lowest. |
| Humidity Trends           | **Humidity peaks** during monsoon (mid-year), while driest levels were observed in late winter. |
| Visibility Patterns       | **Visibility drops** significantly during rainy months and improves in dry seasons. |
| Correlation Analysis      | **Strong negative correlation** (‚âà -0.7) between **temperature & humidity**; moderate between temp & visibility (+0.4). |
| Extreme Weather Events    | Identified **hottest days** (e.g. >40‚ÄØ¬∞C) and **most humid days** (>90% RH), highlighting seasonal extremes. |
- **Techniques & Tools Used:**
  - Data preprocessing (timestamp parsing, missing data handling)
  - Statistical analysis and trend lines with `pandas` and `NumPy`
  - Visualization: line plots, scatter plots, box plots
  - Seasonal trend breakdown and correlation analysis
